<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
ShareTab is a collaborative browser client-server application. It was originally developed for linux, so ShareTabWin is 
the name of the Windows version of ShareTab.
</p>
	<p>
	ShareTab allows mutiple users to get together over a network and work 
	together in order to research information on the internet. They can surf 
	individually (in private) or in a common session led by one of them.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
ShareTab has everything it needs in its local folder. 
That makes installation particularily simple. All you
have to do is extract the contents of ShareTabWin-0.3.zip 
somewhere in your system (such as C:\programs\) and then
doubleclick ShareTabWin.exe.
</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>
ShareTab has features that can be grouped as follows:</p>
<dl id="featurelist">
<dt>Private browsing</dt>
<dd>You can use ShareTab like a plain old tabbed web browser.
It works almost like an older version of Firefox, because it
uses the Gecko renderer. If you are connected to a ShareTab
server, you can upload any private tab to the shared browsing
session by right clicking in the Tabs panel and selecting <em>
Share tab</em>, or by pressing Ctrl-P.</dd>
<dt>Shared browsing</dt>
<dd>When connected to a ShareTab server, you can select 
<em>Session, Watch</em> to see the opened public tabs. These
tabs are controlled by the current broadcaster. If you are not
the broadcaster, you can still get a copy of the tab to use
in private, by right clicking in the Tabs panel and selecting
<em>Get a private copy</em>. If you are not the broadcaster but
you would like to be, just ask the current broadcaster to
stop broadcasting, and then you can simply select it.</dd>
<dt>Scrapbook</dt>
<dd>When connected to a ShareTab server, you can send fragments
of web pages to the special Scrapbook page hosted on the 
server. The scrapbook page is editable by the broadcaster
and it is a good place to gather the found results.
All you have to do is select a fragment, right-click it
and select the <em>Send to scrapbook</em> option.</dd>

<dt>Sketching</dt>
<dd>By clicking <em>Edit, Sketch</em> or pressing Ctrl-K you can open a sketch overlay on top 
of the current page. If the current tab is public, then
everybody else will see your drawings. In order to clear
the sketch, click <em>Edit, Clear sketch</em> or push Ctrl-Shift-K.</dd>
