<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
ShareTab is a collaborative browser client-server application. It was originally developed for linux, so ShareTabWin is 
the name of the Windows version of ShareTab.
</p>
	<p>
	ShareTab allows mutiple users to get together over a network and work 
	together in order to research information on the internet. They can surf 
	individually (in private) or in a common session led by one of them.</p>
	<p>
	ShareTabWin targets the .NET 4.0 platform from Microsoft, on systems where 
	this is not available it must be installed before running ShareTabWin.</p>
<h2 id="devenv">Development environment</h2>
<p>
ShareTab was written using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional. Parts of 
it were visually designed using Microsoft Expression Blend and Microsoft 
Expression Design.</p>
	<p>
	The language used everywhere in the project is C#. The client part targets 
	the <acronym>WPF</acronym>, while the client&ndash;server communication part targets
	the <acronym>WCF</acronym>.
</p>
	<p>
	The UI programming is event driven to ensure extensibility, and binding 
	driven for clean code. For example, everytime the client receives an update 
	from the server, a particular event is raised. The controller for the 
	particular client-side model handles the event by updating the collection 
	(adding the newly connected user, for example). The user interface is bound 
	to the collection and automatically updates when it changes.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>
ShareTabWin is structured in 3 projects: </p>
<dl id="structurelist">
<dt>Infrastructure</dt>
<dd>The common datatypes used for communicating between the client and the server. This
is implementation agnostic, but all data needs to be marked as serializable. </dd>
<dt>Communication</dt>
<dd>Contains the WCF architecture of the ShareTab server and the ShareTab client components.
By extending the base WCF service classes this offers a robust communication protocol.</dd>
<dt>ShareTabWin</dt>
<dd>The ShareTab graphical user interface and interaction code. Apart from the other projects
mentioned above, this depends on outside libraries such as AvalonDock, GeckoFX, xulrunner
(more in the next section)</dd>

</dl>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>ShareTab depends on the following components:</p>
<dl id="componentlist"><dt>AvalonDock</dt><dd>Docking manager
for WPF with autohide and floating capabilities. Hosted at
<a href="http://avalondock.codeplex.com/">http://avalondock.codeplex.com/</a>.</dd>
<dt>GeckoFX</dt><dd>WinForms browser control based on Gecko 
and xulrunner. A very unstable project, causes most
of our bugs. Available at <a href="http://geckofx.org/">http://geckofx.org/</a></dd></dl>
